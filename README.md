<h3 align="center"> I am not currently working on this app </h3>
<p align = "left"> - Idea for this app came from one betting webside (later turned out it was a scam). On the webside you could bet if price of the Bitcoin will drop or raise in next 30 sec/1 hour etc. I wanted to test if I can predict what will happen with Bitcoin in the next 30 seconds. </p>
<p align = "left"> - Application works with downloaded csv files from Bitcoin archiv, calculates some variables like moving avarage, bull/bear market etc. Then simulates on given formula when I would bet. After all the files excel file will be generated in Output folder with some information like succes rate, money needed for profit etc.</p>
<p align="left"> - Trading strategy is that when you bet and loose, you will bet 2x more next time so profit from next win will cover your previous losses. Therefore we can see in column "Max investment" the biggest one time bet we would have to pay to recover loses. Therefore if we would like to make this app work for real trading we would have to minimalise lose streak, that will lower max investment </p>
